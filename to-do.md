# To Do üìÉ
- Determine if observable subscriptions need to be unsubscribed from
  - Then unsubscribe.
- Create Angular library for the validation module and separate the deployable stuff into its own
- Figure out how to make group validation cleaner.
  - Create a helper that takes whatever is needed and abstracts this part away.
  - Should the helper go in the validation service, or should it be its own thing?
- Make a shared component with its own formgroup
  - Add a form model
  - Add a form service and compose validation
  - Ensure it initializes with empty data to begin with
  - Expose an input for the form group
- Plug in the component to the sandbox in multiple places, nested under different circumstances
  - In one place, add a validation rule
  - In another place, reset the validation rules altogether
- Solve nested forms in the simplest way that is still maintainable / scalable / reusable üò¨
- Validator registration: need order, message, and ValidatorFn registered with the validator store
  - Determine where to put validation summaries for custom validators
  - Determine where to put validation summaries for built-in validators
- Add a custom validator where name cannot be "Sideshow Bob" and configure with new configuration strategy
  - Is this scalable?
- (Ongoing) Solve sandbox scenarios
- Add Kendo UI with the Bootstrap theme
- Add open sans regular, semibold, and bold
- Set up open sans as the main font
- Apply some basic styles globally and then use in the validation control component for structuring the content
- Add support for validation decoration on basic Kendo controls
  - This could be already done by Kendo, else a directive may suffice to style Kendo controls as errored.
- Add hook for customizing error messages
- Remove magenta box shadows; too much trouble to persist across all inputs
- ...

# Notes üìù

## Validation Grouping
Because form group validation doesn't come stocked with the ability to decorate child controls when the form itself is invalid, I had to come up with the concept of a manual validator.
Currently, it only supports one instance of manual validation on the control at a time. 
‚ùì How do we set up multiple manual validation scenarios for one input?

## Nested form groups
I've read various Medium articles on how to share components that have validation rules built in.
Some of the options available: 
- Pass the relevant form group down and let the child work with that
- Have the child declare their own form group and have the parent dynamically tack it on
- Use control value accessors
- ...

## Composing validation
The right way and the simplest way are sometimes one and the same. I took the simplest approach by making an AppValidators static class with static props that represent the canned validators, their default error messages, their priority, and their ValidatorFn for reactive forms.
